<p style="font-size:20px">Server- in computer terminology, this term can refer to an individual computer or program. The main feature in both cases is the ability of a machine or program to work autonomously most of the time, without human intervention, responding to external events in accordance with the installed software. Human intervention is carried out during the installation of the server and during its service maintenance. This is often done by individual highly qualified server administrators.<br><b><i>LetsMine</i></b>- is a Ukrainian RP (Roleplay) project, created for the pleasant game of Ukrainians and foreigners. 
It is developed by a team of teenagers who modernize the project every day and try to make something out of it
more interesting. There are also additional datapacks on the server, developed by the team itself and all for convenient RP</p>
